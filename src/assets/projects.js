      description: "After mastering the basics and building medium-sized websites, I craved a challenge that would push my skills from design through to deployment. My background in accounting, dealing with stock costing, reconciliation, and stock-outs, sparked an idea: create a stock management application to streamline these processes. This led to the development of an experimental app that uses the FIFO (First In, First Out) method for inventory management. The application revolutionizes how businesses track stock levels, manage orders, and maintain efficient inventory turnover.",
      build_process: "The journey began with building the application using React and Node.js, complemented by MongoDB for its flexible data storage capabilities. MongoDB's ability to embed related data made it a perfect fit. To ensure a robust schema, I utilized Mongoose. As I delved into Next.js, I decided to migrate the application to leverage its powerful features like NextAuth, seamless routing, server-side rendering, and streaming. This transition not only enhanced the app's performance but also opened new avenues for scalability and user experience.Next.js also eliminated the need for a separate server codebase. This allowed me to leverage React Server Components for seamless database interactions.",
      challenges: "I am no designer by any stretch of the imagination, so the initial web app was not aesthetically pleasing. As a result, I rebuilt the entire UI. One of the biggest challenges was developing algorithms to deduct ordered products from the relevant stock while maintaining the FIFO design. This required careful planning and testing to ensure accuracy and efficiency.Authentication was another significant challenge. I initially used a third-party package, but my implementation was flawed. Migrating to Next.js was the best decision as it is a full-fledged framework that comes with built-in authentication features.You can view the source code.",

      build_process: "The app served as a challenge to produce a product within a restricted timeline and limited resources. Consequently, I used vanilla JavaScript and CSS. I consumed third-party REST APIs and rendered the data on the frontend. To minimize API calls, I stored the API responses in local storage and read from there.",
      tech: ["Vanilla JavaScript", "CSS", "HTML", "Local Storage"],
      challenges:"Building an e-commerce convenience store with vanilla JavaScript and third-party REST APIs presents several challenges. Managing asynchronous operations and handling API integration can be complex, requiring robust error handling and understanding of data formats. Storing data efficiently in local storage, ensuring responsive design, and optimizing performance are crucial for a smooth user experience. Additionally ensuring accessibility and cross-browser compatibility further complicates the development process. Overall, careful planning and testing are essential to overcome these challenges and deliver a functional, user-friendly application."
